2021-11-15 - `modulo_vki == 1.1.6`
-----------------------------------
- Fixed bug in memory saving for POD, 
- `N_modes` introduced, it is now possible to define the number of modes to compute for POD, mPOD and DMD, 
- Randomised SVD implemented as standard solver for the eigenvalue problems, 
- *DMD implemented!*
- Improved printed messages, 
- Possibility to control the parameter SAT as a self variable of the class. This lets the user control the largest number of modes that will be computed in each scale
