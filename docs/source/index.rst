MODULO (MODal mULtiscale pOd): Data-Driven Modal Analysis
==========================================================

MODULO (MODal mULtiscale pOd) is a software developed at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics to perform data-driven modal decompositions.
Initially focused on the Multiscale Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (mPOD), it has recently been extended to perform also other decompositions that include POD, SPODs, DFT, DMD, mPOD.
