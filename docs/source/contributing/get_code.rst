Base contributions
===================

We recommended to perform a shallow clone of the repository to avoid downloading the entire history of the project:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mendezVKI/MODULO.git

This will download only the latest version of the repository, which is sufficient for contributing to the project, and will save 
you time and disk space.

To create a new feature, please submit a pull request, specifying the proposed changes and 
providing an example of how to use the new feature (that will be included in the `examples/` folder).

The pull request will be reviewed by the MODULO team before being merged into the main branch, and your contribution duly acknowledged.
