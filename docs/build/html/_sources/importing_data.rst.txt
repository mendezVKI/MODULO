Importing data and D matrix preparation
----------------------------------------

MODULO can operate with two options.

**Option 1**: the snapshot matrix is provided by the users. MODULO accepts ``numpy.array`` data matrices only.
We use this feature in Example 1.

**Option 2**: a folder containing the data is provided and MODULO must assemble the snapshot matrix.
We use this feature in Example 2.

When operating with MEMORY_SAVING=True, MODULO will refrain from working on the full matrix D:

- if this matrix was provided (Option 1), MODULO will break the data into partitions, store them in a local folder and delete D from memory.
- if only the data folder was provided (Option 2), then MODULO will group the snapshots in different partitions and store them in a local folder.

The format expected for the data is ``.dat`` or ``.txt``.  Variants for ``.csv`` files are in preparation.

The codes to generate the matrix D are available in  ``ReadData``. The main function is 
*_data_processing* in *read_db.py*.
