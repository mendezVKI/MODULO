# Note

This is the first implementation of MODULO in Python, with key contributions by @Fran Torres and @Lorenzo Schena.

This branch contains two main folders:

1. Python_first_Implementation. This contains three of the four exercises from the Matlab version in the other branch. Most of the codes were adapted directly from the Matlab implementation. I keep this folder because I occasionally use it in my courses. Notably, Fran has introduced a parallelized method for generating the matrix D, which has yet to be incorporated into the final version of MODULO.
