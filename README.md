# Note

This is the first implementation of MODULO in Python, with key contributions by @Fran Torres and @Lorenzo Schena.

This branch contains two main folders:

1. Python_first_Implementation. This includes three of the four exercises from the Matlab version in the other branch. Most of the codes were adapted directly from the Matlab implementation. I keep this folder because I occasionally use it in my courses. Notably, Fran has introduced a parallelized method for generating the matrix D, which has yet to be incorporated into the final version of MODULO.

2. modulo_python_package. This is the first (installable) Python package, mostly developed by L. Schena. This folder also contains the tutorial that L. Schena provided here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2uSvdxAwHk. This sets the foundations of Version 2 in the main branch, where major improvements have been proposed (see the main branch).
