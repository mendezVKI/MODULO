# MODULO: A package for Multiscale Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
MODULO (MODal mULtiscale pOd) is a software developed at the von Karman Institute to perform Multiscale Modal Analysis of numerical and experimental data using the Multiscale Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (mPOD).

The theoretical foundation of the decomposition is described in

 Example of applications of the mPOD are shown in

Currently, this repository contains five exercises. 
Of these, two are done both in Matlab and in Python, while the remaining ones are only available in Matlab. The exercises include 1D and 2D cases with both scalar and vectorial quantities.

All the codes so far assume that the dataset is equally spaced both in space (i.e. along a Cartesian grid) and in time.
TR-PIV or video sequences satisfy these conditions easily. 
Other simple exercises using Finite Difference are also considered (ex.1, ex.2, ex. 3).

The proposed exercises are the following:

1- Decomposition of the velocity profile of a pulsating Poiseuille flow (1D, scalar). The theoretical background for the analytical solution is described in M.A. Mendez,J.-M Buchlin, VKI-TN 215, 2016, pdf available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304538821_Notes_on_2D_Pulsatile_Poiseuille_Flows_An_Introduction_to_Eigenfunction_Expansion_and_Complex_Variables_using_Matlab/stats.
(Available in Python and Matlab)

2- Decomposition of a Synthetic Test case
(Available only in Matlab)

3- Decomposition of the Vorticity field of a 2D simulation in Matlab.
(Available only in Matlab)

4- Decomposition of a TR-PIV measurement of an impinging jet.
(Available in Python and Matlab)

5- Decomposition of a TR-PIV measurement of a flow past a cylinder.
(Available only in Matlab)

Exercises 2,3 and 4 are taken from the article at https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09646 .
Exercise 5 is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01971.

A standalone application is available in the section "Release" of this repository.
This is equipped with a Graphical User Interface developed by D. Ninni and presented in
