# Note

This is the first implementation of MODULO in Python, with key contributions by @Fran Torres.

I prefer keeping track of it because of didactic purposes, as I use some of this material during my courses.

The repository contains three of the four exercises from the Matlab version in the other brunch.

Notably, Fran has introduced a parallelized method for generating the matrix D, which has yet to be incorporated into the final version of MODULO.
